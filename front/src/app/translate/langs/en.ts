  'coo2plan.text1': `Coo2plan is our cherished project. A unique application
    whose aim is to connect public administrations, citizens and urban planners
    gathering them on participatory design of urban spaces. This project lead us
    to winning the 2012’s open call ‘Bollenti Spiriti’.`,
  'coo2plan.text2': `Participatory design is an extraordinary mean, inclusive
    and revolutionary within decision procedures. Throughout our research we
    realized the need to make those procedures transparent and we do believe that
    the web offers an incredible chance of democratization. This is where Coo2plan
    was born: a unified portal, transparent, useful on managing decision
    procedures, whether they’re stand alone ones or linked to real participation.
    What are the features that the application must have?
    <ul>
    <li>Registration and identity check</li>
    <li>Open text editor for project publications</li>
    <li>Platform for topic discussions among citizens</li>
    <li>Projects geolocalization</li>
    <li>Extraction mode for most voted ideas</li>
    <li>Participation’s dynamic stats presentation</li>
    <li>Discussion’s topic definition</li>
    <li>Dynamic calendar to manage real participation</li>
    </ul>
    The application we created with this portfolio of solutions is written in
    node.js and Angular, it is flexible and highly dynamic, easily implemented
    on PA’s platforms as easily expandable with new features in order to
    diversify participatory procedures. The application is completely responsive
    and characterized by a solid security component, aimed to identify the
    subscribers and their physical identities as well as store a large amount of
    sensitive data.`,
  'coo2plan.text3': `Coo2plan is still an open challenge: keeps on growing
    together with us and our knowledge within software development and
    participated planning. As of now Coo2plan is the first and only tool managing
    participated procedures for 100% online municipalities. We like thinking of it
    as a tool available for the city, the citizens.`,

We work together testing new models and research features, teaching, mentoring and co-living. We deal with research, whether it’s a public or private one, teaching for kids and adults, unemployed, professional, retired or managers; we create products and services, developing technologies and human capital through social and technological innovation”`,
  'sos.text2': `The board of La Scuola Open Source reached out to us for teaching purposes within their XYZ workshop, built to create the basis of the school itself: their aim was to develop a management software connecting students with courses and workshops.
    An immersive 10 days experience where, together with a strong and young team,
    we could work on designing the software mapping the features that it should
    have had:
    <ul>
    <li>Sign in as teacher/student</li>
    <li>Subscribe to courses and manage their contents</li>
    <li>Contribute to a “marketplace of ideas” where new trainings could be introduced</li>
    <li>Promote interaction among students</li>
    <li>Know locations and purposes of the school</li>
    <li>Draft a dynamic profile for every skill acquired at the school</li>
    </ul>
    Following the workshop, La Scuola Open Source reached out to us again aiming
    to start the developing phase of the management software, arranged together
    with the board and based on the information gathered during XYZ.`,
  'sos.text3': `We opted for Microservices modular architecture, easy to
    implement and expand and we worked with Scala, node.js and Angular. The
    application features a backend that allows to moderate and manage the platform
    and a frontend intended for interaction among students and teachers. The
    simplicity of the interaction itself and the smoothness of the experience
    where our keyframe during the whole developing phase. Database security was
    fundamental, having to store subscribers data and payment information. An
    amazing experience that saw us deeply engaged and allowed us to work in close
    contact with users.`,
